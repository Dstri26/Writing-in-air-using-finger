## Why do we use HSL instead of HSV?

First image is HSL and Second one is HSV
    
We use HSL because :
    
 In HSL, the Saturation component always goes from fully saturated color to the equivalent gray (in HSV, with V at
 maximum, it goes from saturated color to white, which may be considered counterintuitive).
    
 The Lightness in HSL always spans the entire range from black through the chosen hue to white (in HSV, the V
component only goes half that way, from black to the chosen hue).
